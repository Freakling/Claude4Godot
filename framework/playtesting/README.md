# Playtesting

Two kinds of session feed the game's design and its bug list:

| | Asks | You fill in | The assistant turns it into |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Playtest** | How does it play and feel? | `TEMPLATE.md`: scores, answers, bugs, free comments | bug items, design proposals for you to decide, score trends |
| **Function check** | Does each built rule work as written? | a generated checklist: tick Works or Broken | bug items, and design questions when a rule itself seems wrong |

Rules that can be tested automatically are proven by `bash tools/check.sh` on every change. A function check covers only what needs a person: feel, visuals, input and UI flow.

## Playtest
1. Say "new playtest" (in Claude Code also `/playtest new`). This creates `playtesting/YYYY-MM-DD-playtest.md` from `TEMPLATE.md`, with the build filled in.
2. Play, then fill it in. Skip loops you didn't reach. A score with no comment is still useful, and the free-format section matters as much as the scores.
3. Say "process my playtest". Bugs are filed straight away. Design findings come back as options with a recommendation, and nothing in the design changes until you choose. Scores are compared with earlier reports that use the same statement.

Each loop in the template has one fixed scored statement, so scores stay comparable across builds. If you reword a statement, it starts a new series.

## Function check
1. Say "prepare a function check" (in Claude Code also `/function-check`). This writes `playtesting/YYYY-MM-DD-function-check.md` with everything built since the last check that needs a human eye. Say "function check all" for a full regression round.
2. For each item, tick **Works** or **Broken / missing**, and say what went wrong in Notes. Leave both boxes empty for anything you didn't check; it comes back next time.
3. Say "process the function check". Broken items become bugs. A note saying the rule itself should change becomes a design question for you.

## Files
- `TEMPLATE.md`: the report template. It's yours, with one section per core gameplay loop.
- `YYYY-MM-DD-playtest.md` and `YYYY-MM-DD-function-check.md`: one file per session. Once processed, a file gets a `Processed:` line listing the bugs, tasks and questions it produced.
