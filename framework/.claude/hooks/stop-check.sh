# When Claude is about to finish a turn and code, scenes or data differ from the last commit,
# run the project check. The check itself skips work when nothing changed since its last pass.
# If the check fails, block once and hand the output back to Claude. The same failing state isn't
# reported twice, so a turn can still end after Claude has explained a failure it can't fix.
# Turn it off per machine with GODOT_DIRECTOR_STOP_CHECK=0 (e.g. .claude/settings.local.json › env).
